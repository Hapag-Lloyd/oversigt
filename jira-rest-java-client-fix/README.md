# JIRA REST Client Fix
This package fixes the usage of Atlassians JIRA Rest Client Implementation by adding Fugue to the dependencies and improves the JIRA REST Client by adding a Guice injectable socket timeout named `jiraSocketTimeout`.

## Getting started
This package is part of [the Oversigt project](../README.md).
