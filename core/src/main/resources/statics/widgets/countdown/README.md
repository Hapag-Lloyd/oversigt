## Countdown. REVISED EDITION!!!! 

This is a fork of ruleb's count down that rended one of the else ifs unreachable in his code. Even though he was notified by menny people he never fixed his code so i took it on to... fix 1 line of code. This Fork may expand if i have the time to re-learn coffie and see if any outher code is broken.

The rest of this readme and the html code and scss is still the orginal by ruleb.
